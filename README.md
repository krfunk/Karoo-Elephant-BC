# Abstract

African elephants (Loxodonta africana) translocated to the semi-arid Nama-Karoo biome in South Africa present a unique opportunity to study body condition in a resource-scarce environment. We used a longitudinal dataset spanning four years to examine how body condition varies in relation to seasonality, rainfall, and age-sex classes. Contrary to our predictions, rainfall and seasonal changes had limited influence on body condition. Instead, year-round availability of principal forage, including resilient plant species such as Vachellia karroo, likely buffered elephants from seasonal fluctuations in body condition. Adult females exhibited the highest body condition scores, while adult males had the lowest, challenging findings from other populations in more resource-abundant habitats. Juvenile elephants had intermediate scores, contrary to predictions that resource scarcity would predominantly affect younger age groups. These findings suggest that current density and resource availability on this fenced reserve support acceptable body condition levels, comparable to other South African fenced reserves. This study underscores the importance of adaptive management practices in marginal environments and highlights potential implications of life history traits and contraception use for elephant welfare and population dynamics.
